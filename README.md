# Dotfiles â€“ Arch Linux

Personal configuration files for a clean, minimal setup on Arch Linux.

## Included

- `hypr/`: Hyprland config, split into modules for better organization.
- `kitty/`: Kitty terminal config. Uses `starship.toml` for the prompt.
- `waybar/`: Status bar styling and layout.
- `nvim/`: Neovim setup using Lua and Lazy.nvim.
- `starship/`: Prompt configuration used mainly with Kitty.

All configs are symlinked into `~/.config` from this repo.

## Notes

- Files are structured to be easily reusable across systems.
